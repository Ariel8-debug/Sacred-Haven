Secret Haven
==================
## What this project does
This project is supposed to connect people to comfort. It's for everyone to request services that are fit for them like cuddles, trips, and more.
## Why this project is useful
This is useful because it allows more people to open to the idea of others helping them, and the idea of self love in the sense that it is okay to take a break sometimes 
## How we built this 
I built this using HTML, a lot of research, and a lot of confusion. 
## Accomplishments that we are proud of 
I'm honestly proud that I was able to get it to become an actual website with a url and everything. And that I coded in HTML after like five years. I was also happy about the fact that I was able to find a suitable text editor and online proofreader: Visual Studio Code and Liveweaver so I could check the code and how it looks in the real world. 
## What is next for this project
To add CSS and Javascript so that it looks more like a modern website with tabs instead of links as well as to have more of a pleasing effect.
